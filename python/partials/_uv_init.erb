For managing our project, we use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). 
For more information on the initial setup with uv, refer to [setting up a python environment](/docs/python/the-basics/initial-setup).
We can initialize a new project like so:

```cmd
uv init <%= runtime.downcase %>-app
cd <%= runtime.downcase %>-app
uv run python
```
